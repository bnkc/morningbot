## What is it?

I live in Ohio, which basically the weather is incredibly unpredictable, sort of like Horton Hears a Who! Because of this, checking the weather on a daily basis is a must. Sometimes I forget and step outside in shorts to quickly find myself in ankle high snow. **Morning Bot** makes sure this doesnt happen. Every morning I recieve a text from **Morning Bot** that gives cliff notes on what the weather is like. Additionally **Morning Bot** is location dependant on your phone. Yes, this means you can travel and still get weather updates on wherever you might find yourself.

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that Morning Bot does well:

  - Weather updates every morning without you clicking a button
  - Easily `configurable` to recieve the morning texts at your desired time using [**Heroku Scheduler**](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler)
